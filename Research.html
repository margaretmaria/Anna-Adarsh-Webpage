<h4>The Cluster management</h4>
<p>A cluster manager usually is a backend graphical user interface or command-line software that runs on one or all cluster nodes The cluster manager works together with a cluster management agent. The key idea is to Administering and managing University's HPC cluster using Slurm.

  <h4>Pervasive Parallelism</h4>
	  <p> The <a href="http://ppl.stanford.edu" >Pervasive Parallelism Lab (PPL)</a> is developing
		the hardware and software infrastructure for scalable
		parallel computing. The key idea is to use domain
		specific languages to simplify parallel programming
		and extract the concurrency and locality information
		necessary to map an application on a highly parallel
		system. PPL is a multi-faculty effort. I am active in
		the areas of architecture, runtime environments, and
		operating systems.

	  <h4>Secure Systems (2006-2010) </h4> <p> We are using tagged memories to
	  create robust, high-performance frameworks for software security. <a
	   href="http://raksha.stanford.edu">Raksha</a> provides
	  hardware support for dynamic information ﬂow tracking (DIFT)
	  in order to protect deployed user-level programs and the
	  operating systems from attacks ranging from buffer overflow
	  to SQL injections.  Loki implements fine-grain,
	  protection for physical memory in order to reduce the
	  trusted code base of <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/histar/" >HiStar</a>, an operating system that	  prevents information leaks. Our work ranges from hardware
	  support to security policies and includes the development of
	  full-system prototypes. </p>


<h4>The Cascade Project (2002 - 05)</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cray.com"
>Cray</a> <a
 href="http://investors.cray.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98390&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=934559&highlight"
>Cascade</a> project targeted a practical PetaFlop supercomputing
system for the national security and industrial user community in the
2007 – 2010 timeframe. The effort included researchers from Cray,
Stanford, Caltech, and Notre Dame and was funded by DARPA IPTO within
the HPCS program. Our work focused the development of a scalable
micro-architecture for vector processors as well as flexible support
for data-level and thread-level parallelism in large-scale
supercomputing systems.</p>

		I am broadly interested in <strong>Computer Systems Architecture</strong>, the hardware, software, and
		interactions between the two. The focus on my recent
		work has been on resource efficiency, large-scale
		parallelism, parallelism, and security. I also like
		building and debugging full-system prototypes of all types.
