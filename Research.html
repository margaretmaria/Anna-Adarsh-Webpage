<h4>The Cluster management</h4>
<p>A cluster manager usually is a backend graphical user interface or command-line software that runs on one or all cluster nodes The cluster manager works together with a cluster management agent. The key idea is Administering and managing University's HPC cluster using Slurm.
</p>

  <h4>GPU system administration</h4>
	  <p>Focus is on Evaluating the performance overhead caused by virtualization in a GPU based cluster. A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel.

	  <h4>Resource Provisioning </h4> <p> Dynamic resource provisioning aims at maintaining the end-to-end response time of a web application within a pre-defined SLA </p>

<h4>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h4>
<p>Developed power-aware software systems that utilized 10% less power than other systems that performed the same job on the same hardware.Worked with Prof. Zhang on implementing a system that efficiently mined Enterprise search engine corpus by issuing aggregate queries to its database </p>
